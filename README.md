# Solo Project

## Instructions

This is an Individual project, that will be due towards the end of the cohort. This should be a project that you can add to your resume as a passion project/ something to show off to a potential employer. It should be something you can continue working on after the cohort has ended. You can use clone your starter project to get started with this. I will be doing mock interviews using this project as both a type of application and to lead the interview. Think about this less of an assignment for school and more like an actual project that is going out in the real world, so things like linted code that follows convection and a clean UI/UX, bug free, etc is important.
